# microDoppler_classification
This code was used to generate images for the micro Doppler signature classfication project. 

##microDoppler_to_spec.m
The main simulation functions were taken from MATLAB's *Introduction to Micro Doppler Effects*, which can be found here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/examples/introduction-to-micro-doppler-effects.html 
I do not own any of that code, more details can be found in the script. 

All other code in the script is under MIT License, if it's useful for anyone.
